This repository contains the Monarch Initiative web application.

### Environment setup

There may be some one-time installation of tools, depending upon whether you have the supported version of NodeJS running. NodeJS v8.12.0 is currently supported, although the project will likely build fine with later versions of NodeJS. If the following command fails, then you probably do not have NodeJS installed:

```bash
node -v
```

If the above command fails or if it reports a version number significantly different from `v8.12.0`, then you should install `nvm` and then install the correct version of NodeJS. We have provided detailed instructions at the end of this document [Installing NodeJS](#installing-nodejs).

### Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Compiles and minifies for production, runs http-server

```
npm run buildandserve
```

### Deploy to gh-pages branch

Use `npm run ghpublish`, which will run `publish.sh`, which will:
- Build into dist/
- Push to the gh-pages branch of the current `origin` repository.

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Run your unit tests

```
npm run test:unit
```

### Run your end-to-end tests

```
npm run test:e2e
```


### Run both types of test

```
npm run test
```

## Installing NodeJS

There is some one-time setup that needs to be completed before you can build and develop the application. Most of this is involved with ensuring that you have a compatible version of NodeJS installed.

### Install NodeJS v8.12.0

The existing application is buildable with v8.12.0, so these instructions will encourage the use of that version until further notice. It *might* be possible to build with earlier or later versions of NodeJS, but that has not been tested and these instructions are intended to be mostly foolproof.

#### Mac users without `homebrew`

If you don't have [homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you should install it.

#### Mac users with `homebrew`

If you have `homebrew` installed, but haven't run it in a while, you should update it with:

- `brew update`
- `brew upgrade`

##### Troubleshooting the Homebrew install

If the above update/upgrade instructions do not work, it may mean that you have upgraded MacOSX to High Sierra or beyond, and the older version of homebrew isn't able to auto-update itself. MacOSX High Sierra and beyond have modified the default security settings and file permissions so that older versions of `homebrew` may not work correctly and may not even update. If this appears to have happened to you, you will need to uninstall the old version and install the latest `homebrew`. See [FAQ](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ) and search for 'How do I uninstall Homebrew?', which says that you should uninstall via the following:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```

### Install `nvm` - Node Version Manager

[nvm - Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is used to ensure that you are running the correct version of NodeJS. The instructions at [Installation](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) should be sufficient for Mac/Unix. Mac users can alternatively use `homebrew` as described below).

#### Easy Install of `nvm` via `homebrew` on Mac

You can use `brew install nvm` to install `nvm`, saving yourself a lot of hassle if it works right. See [How to install NVM (Node Version Manager) with Homebrew](https://www.wdiaz.org/how-to-install-nvm-with-homebrew/).

After installing `nvm`, you will need to modify your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` as per the instructions linked above. The most important part of those instructions is likely the addition of the following to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
. "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh"
```

We recommend exiting your terminal session and starting a new one, to verify that `nvm` is properly installed with:

```bash
nvm
```

which should print the Node Version Manager help text to the terminal.


### Update to NodeJS v8.12.0 using `nvm`

Now we can use `nvm` to install and select a specific version of NodeJS. We are currently supporting NodeJS v8.12.0. The default NodeJS installation may be an earlier or later version, which is why we use `nvm`:

- `nvm install v8.12.0`
- `nvm use v8.12.0`

By default, you will need to type `nvm use v8.12.0` before any development session, which can become tedious and error-prone. It may be convenient to set v8.12.0 as your default with the command:

```bash
nvm alias default 8.12.0
```

### Determining your current version

```bash
~ $ nvm current
v8.12.0
```
